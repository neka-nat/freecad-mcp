## Available tools

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `create_document` | Create a new FreeCAD document. |
| `list_documents` | List open documents. |
| `reload_document` | Close and reopen a saved document to pick up external file changes, such as results from a headless script. |
| `create_object` | Create an object in a document. |
| `edit_object` | Edit an object's properties. |
| `delete_object` | Delete an object from a document. |
| `get_objects` | Get all objects in a document. |
| `get_object` | Get one object in a document. |
| `get_view` | Get a screenshot of the active view. |
| `execute_code` | Execute Python code on FreeCAD's GUI thread. |
| `execute_code_async` | Start a background computation and return its job ID; use `commit()` for document and view access. |
| `get_async_status` | Get background job state and failure tracebacks without using the GUI thread. |
| `execute_code_headless` | Run a script in a separate `freecadcmd` process and return its exit status and output. |
| `get_rpc_status` | Report RPC and GUI-dispatch health without using the GUI thread. |
| `insert_part_from_library` | Insert a part from the [FreeCAD parts library](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-library). |
| `get_parts_list` | List parts in the [FreeCAD parts library](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-library). |
| `run_fem_analysis` | Run CalculiX on an existing analysis and return summary results. |

See [code execution](execution.md) for execution modes, shared script state,
background job tracking, and timeout handling.

## Screenshot options

The following tools return optional screenshots: `create_object`, `edit_object`,
`delete_object`, `execute_code`, `insert_part_from_library`, `get_objects`,
`get_object`, and `run_fem_analysis`.

| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `include_screenshot` | `true` | Set to `false` for text-only feedback, such as analytical scripts or intermediate steps. |
| `view_name` | `"Isometric"` | Orient the returned screenshot, for example `"Front"`, `"Top"`, or `"Right"`. |

The [`--only-text-feedback` flag](configuration.md#text-feedback-and-screenshots)
suppresses these optional screenshots regardless of `include_screenshot`.

Use `get_view` to request a screenshot explicitly; it is available even with
`--only-text-feedback`. It takes `view_name` and optional `width`, `height`, and
`focus_object` parameters. Supported views are `Isometric`, `Front`, `Top`,
`Right`, `Back`, `Left`, `Bottom`, `Dimetric`, and `Trimetric`.

## FEM analysis

`run_fem_analysis` runs the CalculiX solver on an existing `Fem::FemAnalysis`
container. It auto-creates a `SolverCcxTools` if the analysis has none and returns
max von Mises stress, max/min displacement, node count, and the solver's working
directory. The default `timeout` is 600 seconds.

See [`examples/cantilever_fem.py`](../examples/cantilever_fem.py) for an end-to-end
example, including geometry, material, mesh, constraints, and an analytical
comparison. For long analyses, configure the client to allow the
[queue and execution timeout budgets](execution.md#gui-dispatch-timeouts).
